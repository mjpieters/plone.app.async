Introduction
============

This package provides `zc.async`_  integration to Plone for performing
asynchronous job operations.

Installation
============
You will be typically running plone.app.async in a ZEO environment where you
will be having one or more *worker* instances that will be acting as
dispatchers polling and carrying out jobs queued by your main zope instances.
For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that you have one instance that can
queue new jobs, and one worker instance that consumes them both operating on a
single database. In this case, your buildout configuration will look similar
to::

  [zeo]
  ...
  recipe = plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver
  file-storage = ${buildout:directory}/var/filestorage/Data.fs

  [instance]
  ...
  recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
  eggs = Plone
      plone.app.async
  zcml-additional =
      <include package="plone.app.async" file="single_db_instance.zcml" />
  environment-vars =
      ZC_ASYNC_UUID ${buildout:directory}/var/instance-uuid.txt

  [worker]
  ...
  recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
  zserver-threads = 2
  eggs = ${instance:eggs}
  zcml = ${instance:zcml}
  zcml-additional =
      <include package="plone.app.async" file="single_db_worker.zcml" />
  environment-vars =
      ZC_ASYNC_UUID ${buildout:directory}/var/worker-uuid.txt
  zope-conf-additional =
      enable-product-installation off

There are two important stanzas above:

* Each instance has to have the `ZC_ASYNC_UUID` environmental variable to
integrate properly with `zc.async`.
* The worker instance loads the `single_db.zcml` zcml configuration in order
to setup the queue and setup itself as a dispatcher. Also, if the optional
`zc.z3monitor` product configuration is present in the buildout it will be
started.

For more details please look at the buildout configuration included in the package.
